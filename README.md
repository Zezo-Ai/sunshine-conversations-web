## Usage

### Script Tag

Add the following code towards the end of the `head` section on your page and replace `<integration-id>` with your integration id at the end of the script.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<script>
    !function(e,n,t,r){
        function o(){try{var e;if((e="string"==typeof this.response?JSON.parse(this.response):this.response).url){var t=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],r=n.createElement("script");r.async=!0,r.src=e.url,t.parentNode.insertBefore(r,t)}}catch(e){}}var s,p,a,i=[],c=[];e[t]={init:function(){s=arguments;var e={then:function(n){return c.push({type:"t",next:n}),e},catch:function(n){return c.push({type:"c",next:n}),e}};return e},on:function(){i.push(arguments)},render:function(){p=arguments},destroy:function(){a=arguments}},e.__onWebMessengerHostReady__=function(n){if(delete e.__onWebMessengerHostReady__,e[t]=n,s)for(var r=n.init.apply(n,s),o=0;o<c.length;o++){var u=c[o];r="t"===u.type?r.then(u.next):r.catch(u.next)}p&&n.render.apply(n,p),a&&n.destroy.apply(n,a);for(o=0;o<i.length;o++)n.on.apply(n,i[o])};var u=new XMLHttpRequest;u.addEventListener("load",o),u.open("GET","https://"+r+".webloader.smooch.io/",!0),u.responseType="json",u.send()
    }(window,document,"Smooch","<integration-id>");
</script>
```

then initialize the Web Messenger by placing this snippet towards the end of the `body` section of your page.

```html
<script>
    Smooch.init({ integrationId: '<integration-id>' }).then(function () {
        // Your code after init is complete
    });
</script>
```

```

#### open()

Opens the conversation widget (noop when embedded)

```javascript
Smooch.open();
```

#### close()

Closes the conversation widget (noop when embedded)

```javascript
Smooch.close();
```

#### isOpened()

Tells if the widget is currently opened or closed.

```javascript
Smooch.isOpened();
```

#### login(userId , jwt)

Logs a user in the Web Messenger, retrieving the conversation the user already had on other browsers and/or devices. Note that you don't need to call this after `init` if you passed the user id and jwt already, it's done internally. This returns a promise that resolves when the Web Messenger is ready again.

```javascript
Smooch.login('some-id', 'some-jwt');
```

#### logout()

Logs out the current user and reinitialize the widget with an anonymous user. This returns a promise that resolves when the Web Messenger is ready again.

```javascript
Smooch.logout();
```

#### destroy()

Destroys the Web Messenger and makes it disappear. The Web Messenger has to be reinitialized with `init` to be working again because it also clears up the integration id from the Web Messenger. It will also unbind all listeners you might have with `Smooch.on`.

```javascript
Smooch.destroy();
```

#### sendMessage(message, conversationId)

Sends a message on the user's behalf. An optional `conversationdId` argument can be provided to target a specific conversation, otherwise the currently loaded conversation will be targeted.

```javascript
Smooch.sendMessage({
    type: 'text',
    text: 'hello',
});

// OR

Smooch.sendMessage('hello');

// OR

Smooch.sendMessage('hello', '<conversation-id>');
```

#### startTyping(conversationId)

Sends an event indicating the appUser has started typing. When called, a `stopTyping` timer will be created and will call `stopTyping()` after 10s, unless `stopTyping()` has been called manually. Everytime `startTyping()` is called the timer is reset. If `startTyping()` is called repeatedly, an event will only be sent if the time since the last sent event is greater then 10s.

If **conversationId** is not provided, the currently loaded conversation will be used.

```javascript
Smooch.startTyping();

// OR

Smooch.startTyping('<conversation-id>');
```

#### stopTyping(conversationId)

Sends an event indicating the appUser has stoped typing.

If **conversationId** is not provided, the currently loaded conversation will be used.

```javascript
Smooch.stopTyping();

// OR

Smooch.stopTyping('<conversation-id>');
```

#### triggerPostback(actionId, conversationId)

Trigger a [postback](https://docs.smooch.io/rest/#postback) action on the user's behalf. An optional `conversationdId` argument can be provided to target a specific conversation, otherwise the currently loaded conversation will be targeted.

The `actionId` is the `_id` property of the targeted action.

If you have the `_id` of the targetted `postback` action, you can pass it directly to `triggerPostback`.

If **conversationId** is not provided, the currently loaded conversation will be used.

```javascript
const actionId = '5a747faa065bbe4e7804f2a4';
Smooch.triggerPostback(actionId);

// OR

const actionId = '5a747faa065bbe4e7804f2a4';
Smooch.triggerPostback(actionId, '62565b5c2b4039adff80b7fd');
```

Otherwise, you can get the `_id` of an action by using `Smooch.getConversationById()`, e.g.

```javascript
Smooch.getConversationById().then((conversation) => console.log(conversation.messages));

// [
//     {
//         "text": "Do you want to continue?",
//         "actions": [
//             {
//                 "payload": "text:continue",
//                 "text": "Continue conversation",
//                 "_id": "5a7c65211aaa9b61f69c95e3",
//                 "type": "postback"
//             }
//         ],
//         "type": "text",
//         "role": "appMaker",
//         "_id": "5a7c65211aaa9b61f69c95e2",
//         // ...
//     }
// ]

// Indicate to Smooch that the user has clicked on the "Continue conversation" postback action.
Smooch.triggerPostback(conversation.messages[0].actions[0]._id);
```

#### updateUser(user)

Updates user information

```javascript
Smooch.updateUser({
    givenName: 'Updated',
    surname: 'Name',
    email: 'updated@email.com',
    properties: {
        justGotUpdated: true,
    },
});
```

#### getUser()

Returns the current user.

```javascript
var user = Smooch.getUser();
```

#### getConversationById(conversationId)

Returns a `Promise<object>` whose payload is a conversation if it exists.
if **conversationId** is not given, the current loaded conversation will be returned.

```javascript
Smooch.getConversationById('62565b5c2b4039adff80b7fd').then((conversation) => {
    console.log(conversation);
});

// or

Smooch.getConversationById().then((currentConversation) => {
    console.log(currentConversation);
});

// Data object
conversation = {
    _id: '<conversation-id>',
    unreadCount: 0,
    lastUpdatedAt: 1581010017.596,
    type: 'sdkGroup',
    participants: [
        {
            _id: '<participant-id>',
            appUserId: '<appUser-id>',
            unreadCount: 0,
            lastRead: 1581010017.596,
        },
    ],
    metadata: {},
    messages: [
        {
            role: 'appUser',
            authorId: '6ac41c8b32e704f3cdb9052d',
            name: 'Some user',
            _id: '5e6022c9cb55158bfd53f845',
            type: 'text',
            received: 1583358665.139,
            text: 'Hello',
            source: {
                type: 'web',
                id: 'c38ae913af7c4ef3800b339ee529c579',
                integrationId: '5d8274d4aa780a5483f0ee56',
            },
        },
    ],
};
```

#### getConversations(offset)

Returns a list of up to 10 conversations for the current user. An optional `offset` argument can be specified for paging purposes. This method is asynchronous. Note that the `messages` property in each conversation may only have the most recent message in the conversation.

See [Smooch.getConversationById](#getconversationbyidconversationid) for the definition of a conversation

```javascript
Smooch.getConversations(5).then((conversations) => {
    // Your code after receiving the current user's conversations
});
```

#### getConversation()

Returns the active conversation if it exists

See [Smooch.getConversationById](#getconversationbyidconversationid) for the conversation definition

```javascript
var conversation = Smooch.getConversation();
```

#### loadConversation(conversationId)

Loads a conversation into the current session

```javascript
Smooch.loadConversation('<conversation-id>');
```

#### startConversation()

Creates a user and conversation on the server, allowing the business to reach out proactively to the user via the public API.

Creating a conversation via this method will count as an active user conversation (AUC) whether messages are exchanged or not, which may incur cost based on your plan. It is strongly recommended to only call this method in the case where a message is likely to be sent.

This method is called automatically when starting a conversation via the `sendMessage` method, or when a user sends a message via the conversation view.

If a conversation already exists for the current user, this call is a no-op.

```javascript
Smooch.startConversation();
```

#### markAllAsRead(conversationId)

Marks all unread messages as read.

If **conversationId** is not provided, the currently loaded conversation will have its messages marked as read.

```javascript
Smooch.markAllAsRead();

// or

Smooch.markAllAsRead('<conversation-id>');
```

#### showNotificationChannelPrompt()

Displays a prompt to the user suggesting the linking of the current chat instance with other 3rd-party apps.

```javascript
Smooch.showNotificationChannelPrompt();
```

#### setPredefinedMessage(message)

Prefills the user's chat input with a predefined message.

```javascript
Smooch.setPredefinedMessage(message);
```

#### setDelegate(delegate)

Sets a delegate on the conversation. Smooch must be initialized before calling this method. See the [delegate](#delegate) section for more details.

```javascript
Smooch.setDelegate(delegate);
```

### Delegate

Smooch allows you to set a delegate to receive callbacks when important changes happen in the conversation.
To set a delegate, pass the `delegate` parameter in to [init options](#options), or use the [setDelegate](#setdelegatedelegate) method. The `delegate` object may optionally contain `beforeDisplay`, `beforeSend`, `beforePostbackSend` and `onInvalidAuth` delegate functions.

Passing `delegate` as part of `init` options is the preferred method. The `setDelegate` method can be used to change or remove delegate behaviors after a conversation has been initialized.

A `data` object is passed down with all the delegate events except `onInvalidAuth`. This is a read-only object containing a truncated version of the conversation associated with the event.

`beforeSend` delegate will apply to the `formResponse` message sent when a [Prechat Capture](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/web-messenger/#prechat-capture) form is completed.

```javascript
const delegate = {
    beforeDisplay(message, data) {
        if (data.conversation._id === '<my-conversation-id>') {
            message.name = 'Acme Blank';
        }

        return message;
    },
    beforeSend(message, data) {
        return message;
    },
    beforePostbackSend(postback, data) {
        return postback;
    },
    onInvalidAuth() {
        return new Promise((resolve) => resolve('<my-new-auth-token>'));
    },
};

// Passing delegate as an init parameter
Smooch.init({
    integrationId: '<integration-id>',
    delegate,
});

// Using setDelegate
Smooch.init({ integrationId: '<integration-id>' }).then(() => {
    Smooch.setDelegate(delegate);
});

// Data object
data = {
    conversation: {
        _id: '<conversation-id>',
        unreadCount: 0,
        lastUpdatedAt: 1581010017.596,
        type: 'sdkGroup',
        participants: [
            {
                _id: '<participant-id>',
                appUserId: '<appUser-id>',
                unreadCount: 0,
                lastRead: 1581010017.596,
            },
        ],
        metadata: {},
    },
};
```

#### beforeDisplay

The `beforeDisplay` delegate allows a message to be hidden or modified before it is displayed in the conversation. This delegate should return a falsy value such as `null` to hide the message. It can also return a modified message object in order to change what the user will see rendered in their conversation history. Note that this change affects the client side rendering only; the server side copy of this message can not be modified by this delegate.

Learn more about filtering and transforming messages in [our guide](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/web-messenger#filtering-and-transforming-messages).

```javascript
Smooch.init({
    integrationId: '<integration-id>',
    delegate: {
        beforeDisplay(message, data) {
            if (data.conversation._id === '<conversation-id>' && message.metadata && message.metadata.isHidden) {
                return null;
            }

            return message;
        },
    },
});
```

#### beforeSend

The `beforeSend` delegate method allows you to modify properties of a message before sending it to Smooch.
The modified message must be returned for it to take effect.

A common usage of this method is to [add message metadata](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/using-metadata/#sdks-and-metadata).

Note that when a file or an image is uploaded, only the message `metadata` may be updated. Other message properties such as `type` or `text` won't be considered.

```javascript
Smooch.init({
    integrationId: '<integration-id>'
    delegate: {
        beforeSend(message, data) {
            if (data.conversation._id === '<conversation-id>') {
                message.metadata = {
                    any: 'info'
                };
            }

            return message;
        }
    }
});
```

#### beforePostbackSend

The `beforePostbackSend` delegate method allows you to modify properties of a postback before sending it to Smooch.
The modified postback must be returned for it to take effect.

A common usage of this method is to [add postback metadata](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/web-messenger#transforming-postback).

```javascript
Smooch.init({
    integrationId: '<integration-id>',
    delegate: {
        beforePostbackSend(postback, data) {
            if (data.conversation._id === '<conversation-id>') {
                postback.metadata = {
                    any: 'info',
                };
            }

            return postback;
        },
    },
});
```

#### onInvalidAuth

The `onInvalidAuth` delegate notifies the delegate of a failed request due to invalid credentials and allows the implementer to set a new auth token in order to retry the request. The delegate must return a new JWT token as a `string` or `Promise<string>` that will resolve into the JWT.

```javascript
Smooch.init({
    integrationId: '<integration-id>',
    delegate: {
        onInvalidAuth() {
            return '<my-new-auth-token>';
        },
    },
});
```

### Events

If you want to make sure your events are triggered, try to bind them before calling `Smooch.init`.

To bind an event, use `Smooch.on(<event name>, <handler>);`. To unbind events, you can either call `Smooch.off(<event name>, handler)` to remove one specific handler, call `Smooch.off(<event name>)` to remove all handlers for an event, or call `Smooch.off()` to unbind all handlers.

#### ready

```javascript
// This event triggers when init completes successfully... Be sure to bind before calling init!
Smooch.on('ready', function(){
    console.log('the init has completed!');
});

Smooch.init(...).then(function() {
    // init also returns a promise, so you can alternatively specify a .then() callback
});
```

// This event triggers when the widget is destroyed.
Smooch.on('destroy', function () {
    console.log('the widget is destroyed!');
});

Smooch.destroy();
```

});
```

#### participant:removed

```javascript

    } else if (data.role === 'appUser') {
        console.log(`Conversation ${data.conversation._id} was read by appUserId: ${payload.appUserId}`);
    }
});

// Data object, if the conversation was read by the appMaker, the appUser property will not exist
payload = {
    appUserId: '<appUser-id>',
    lastRead: 1581010017.596,
    role: 'appUser',
};

data = {
    conversation: {
        _id: '<conversation-id>',
    },
};
```

    conversation: {
        _id: '<conversation-id>',
    },
};
```

    console.log('Widget is closed!');
});
```

#### log:debug

Smooch.on('log:debug', function (e) {
    console.log('Timestamp:', e.timestamp); // (Float) Date.now() when it was emitted
    console.log('Message:', e.message); // (String) Message being logged
    console.log('Data:', e.data); // (Object) Extra details to be logged
});
```

#### connected

```javascript
// This event triggers when an active connection has been established for the first time,
// or when the connection has been re-established after a `disconnect` event.
Smooch.on('connected', function (data) {
    console.log('Connected with conversation', data.conversation._id);
});
```

#### disconnected

```javascript
// This event triggers when an active connection is lost
// While disconnected, the client will not be able to recieve messages
Smooch.on('disconnected', function (data) {
    console.log('Disconnected with conversation', data.conversation._id);
});

// data object
data = {
    conversation: {
        _id: '<conversation-id>',
    },
};
```

#### typing:start

```javascript
// This event triggers when appMaker starts typing. The associated conversation is passed in the argument.
Smooch.on('typing:start', function (data) {
    console.log(`${data.name} started typing!`, data.conversation._id);
});

// If the name and avatarUrl for the typing user is known it will be available as properties in the data object

// Data object
data = {
    conversation: {
        _id: '<conversation-id>',
    },
    avatarUrl: 'http://path.com/to/avatar-url-of-user',
    name: 'Name of Typing User',
};
```

#### typing:stop

```javascript
// This event triggers when appMaker stops typing. The associated conversation is passed in the argument.
Smooch.on('typing:stop', function (data) {
    console.log(`${data.name} stopped typing!`, data.conversation._id);
});

// data object
data = {
    conversation: {
        _id: '<conversation-id>',
    },
};
```

### Embedded mode

As describe above, to activate the embedded mode, you need to pass `embedded: true` when calling `Smooch.init`. By doing so, you are disabling the auto-rendering mechanism and you will need to call `Smooch.render` manually. This method accepts a DOM element which will be used as the container where the widget will be rendered.

```javascript
Smooch.init({
    integrationId: '<integration-id>',
    embedded: true,
});

Smooch.render(document.getElementById('chat-container'));
```

The embedded widget will take full width and height of the container. You must give it a height, otherwise, the widget will collapse.

### Authenticating the user: init() vs login()

For [authenticated user scenarios](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/authenticating-users/), a user's credentials can be passed in to either `init()` or `login()`. The question remains: when should you use which?

When `init()` is called without a `userId` and `jwt`, the UI will be initialized in an anonymous user context, and the user will be able to send messages as an anonymous user. After `init()` has completed, `login()` may be called to authenticate the user and resume any existing conversation. This is useful if you want your users to be able to send messages before they've logged in to your website. Once a user does login and the browser is issued a valid `jwt`, `login()` may be called so that the user may continue the conversation in an authenticated session.

If however your use case requires that all users be logged in before they may send messages, then you should consider passing `userId` and `jwt` directly to the `init()` call upfront.

## Content Security Policy

If your deployment requires [CSP compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), add the following meta tag to your configuration.

```html
<meta
    http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
    content="
    connect-src
        wss://*.smooch.io
        https://*.smooch.io;
    font-src
        https://*.smooch.io;
    script-src
        https://*.smooch.io;
    style-src
        https://*.smooch.io;
    img-src
        blob:
        https://*.smooch.io;"
/>
```

Note that an equivalent configuration can be done [server side](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy).

According to the channels you use, other domains may need to be added (these are used to display QR codes to link the Web Messenger conversation):

-   LINE: https://qr-official.line.me
-   WeChat: https://mp.weixin.qq.com

Note that your CSP configuration should also include any domains used to host images or files sent in messages.
If you require `blob:` to be excluded for `img-src`, you must disable the image upload feature via the [init settings](#initoptions).
